  <b>PITCH DAY 25â€™</b> was an event where students of Webtech @CSIE presented the projects they worked on the entire semester. Participant students were prompted to specify an amount of fictitious money they would invest in a project, based on their personal criteria. The leaderboard was created based on the amount of money raised by each project.
